def my_function():
    pass  # Placeholder, no actual code here yet

"""
  Placeholder: The primary use of the pass statement is
as a placeholder where syntactically some code is required,
but you don't want to execute any specific instructions. 
  Code Blocks: In Python, code blocks are defined by 
indentation, and an empty code block would raise an error.
  Maintaining Structure: Using pass allows you to maintain 
the indentation and structure of your code, which is 
important in Python.
  Documentation: In some cases, the pass statement is used 
to serve as a placeholder for future documentation. 
  Testing and Debugging: The pass statement can also be 
temporarily inserted for testing or debugging purposes. 
It can help you bypass a particular section of code to 
observe the behavior of the rest of the program.
